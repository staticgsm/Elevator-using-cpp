# Elevator-using-cpp
The objective of this assignment is to simulate an elevator service. Your simulator should take as
input the following parameters:
 The total number of floors.
 The size of the elevator(number of people).
 The time it takes to move between two floors.
 The initial location of the elevator.
a. Your code should randomly generate a number of requests.
b. Design and implement three different algorithms to simulate the elevator movement in order to
response to the requests.
c. For each algorithm, you should log the order in which the requests have been served, the time
it takes to serve each request, and total time it takes to serve all requests.
Submission
You should submit the following items:
a. A report describing your design, implementation, problems faced and how you solved these
problems.
b. Your code.
c. A makefile to build your code.
